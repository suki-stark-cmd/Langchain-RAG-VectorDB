Medical Knowledge Base - Common Diseases and Treatments

Diabetes Mellitus:
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. There are two main types: Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, typically diagnosed in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin, commonly associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing wounds. Treatment for Type 1 includes insulin therapy, blood sugar monitoring, and dietary management. Type 2 treatment involves lifestyle modifications, oral medications like metformin, and sometimes insulin. Complications can include diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease.

Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):
Hypertension is a condition where blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg. It's often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms until complications develop. Risk factors include age, family history, obesity, excessive salt intake, lack of physical activity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. Primary hypertension has no identifiable cause, while secondary hypertension results from underlying conditions like kidney disease or hormonal disorders. Treatment includes lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, healthy diet (DASH diet), weight management, and stress reduction. Medications include ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. Untreated hypertension can lead to heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and heart failure.

Asthma:
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to breathing difficulties. Common triggers include allergens (pollen, dust mites, pet dander), respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, stress, and certain medications. Symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and persistent cough, especially at night or early morning. Asthma is classified as intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent based on symptom frequency and lung function. Treatment involves avoiding triggers, using bronchodilators (rescue inhalers) for acute symptoms, and controller medications like inhaled corticosteroids for long-term management. Peak flow monitoring helps track lung function and guide treatment adjustments.

Coronary Artery Disease:
Coronary artery disease occurs when the major blood vessels that supply the heart become damaged or diseased due to atherosclerosis - the buildup of plaque in arterial walls. Risk factors include high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, family history, age, and sedentary lifestyle. Symptoms may include chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fatigue, and in severe cases, heart attack. Diagnosis involves electrocardiogram (ECG), stress testing, cardiac catheterization, and imaging studies. Treatment includes lifestyle modifications, medications (statins, beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents), and procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. Prevention focuses on controlling risk factors through diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and regular medical monitoring.

Depression:
Major depressive disorder is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. Symptoms include changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and sometimes suicidal thoughts. The exact cause is unknown but involves a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Neurotransmitter imbalances, particularly serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, play a significant role. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy), medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics), or a combination of both. Lifestyle changes including regular exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and social support are also important components of treatment.
