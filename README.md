# Langchain-RAG-VectorDB
## 🏥 Medical RAG System
A powerful Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with LangChain for querying medical knowledge bases using natural language. This system demonstrates modern AI techniques for information retrieval and generation in healthcare applications.
## 📋 Overview
This project implements a comprehensive RAG system that can answer medical questions by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating comprehensive responses. The system supports both simple text-based responses and enhanced AI-powered responses using OpenAI or Google's Generative AI APIs.
## 🚀 Features
- **📄 Document Processing**: Loads and processes medical text documents efficiently
- **✂️ Text Chunking**: Intelligently splits large documents into manageable chunks for better retrieval
- **🔍 Keyword-based Retrieval**: Fast and effective search using advanced keyword matching
- **🧠 Answer Generation**: Extracts and synthesizes relevant sentences to form coherent answers
- **🤖 API Integration**: Optional integration with OpenAI GPT or Google Gemini for enhanced AI responses
- **🏥 Medical Focus**: Specifically designed and optimized for medical knowledge queries
- **⚡ Performance**: Optimized for both speed and accuracy in medical information retrieval
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **OpenAI GPT**: Advanced language models for enhanced responses
- **Google Generative AI**: Alternative AI provider for response generation
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text processing and analysis
## 🚀 Quick Start
### Prerequisites
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install langchain openai langchain-google-genai langchain-community
```
### Installation
1. **📂 Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suki-stark-cmd/Langchain-RAG-VectorDB.git
   cd Langchain-RAG-VectorDB
   ```
2. **📓 Open the Notebook**: Launch `RAG.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code
3. **▶️ Run All Cells**: Execute all cells in order to set up the system
4. **❓ Start Querying**: Use the demo section or create your own medical queries
### 📊 Data Setup
Place your medical knowledge base in a text file named `medical_data.txt` in the project directory. A sample medical knowledge base is already included.
### 🔑 API Keys (Optional for Enhanced Responses)
**OpenAI API:**
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Uncomment the OpenAI setup section in the notebook
3. Enter your API key when prompted
**Google Generative AI:**
1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Uncomment the Google AI setup section in the notebook
3. Enter your API key when prompted
## � Example Queries
Try these sample questions with the system:
- "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
- "How is hypertension treated?"
- "What causes asthma?"
- "What are the risk factors for heart disease?"
- "What medications are used for depression?"
## 🎯 Expected Output
The system will return:
- ✅ Relevant medical information extracted from the knowledge base
- 📖 Source references showing which document chunks were used
- 🎯 Confidence scores for retrieval quality
- ⚡ Response time metrics
## 🏗️ System Architecture
```
User Query → Document Retrieval → Answer Generation → Response
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Question     Keyword Search      Sentence Extract    Formatted
Processing   & Ranking          or API Generation    Answer
```
### Process Flow:
1. **Document Loading**: TextLoader reads the medical knowledge base
2. **Text Splitting**: CharacterTextSplitter creates searchable chunks
3. **Retrieval**: Keyword-based search finds relevant documents
4. **Generation**: Sentence extraction or AI-powered response generation
5. **Response**: Formatted answer with source information
## 📁 Project Structure
```
Langchain-RAG-VectorDB/
├── 📓 RAG.ipynb              # Main notebook with RAG system implementation
├── 📄 medical_data.txt       # Sample medical knowledge base
├── 📋 README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
└── 📁 .git/                 # Git repository files
```
## Customization
### Adjust Search Parameters
```python
# Modify chunk size and overlap
splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
# Change number of retrieved documents
retrieved_docs = simple_search(question, docs, top_k=3)
```
### Add New Data Sources
Simply add more text files or modify the `medical_data.txt` file with additional medical information.
### Enhance Search Algorithm
The current system uses simple keyword matching. You can enhance it by:
- Adding TF-IDF scoring
- Implementing semantic search with embeddings
- Using more sophisticated NLP preprocessing
## 📊 Performance Metrics
| Mode | Response Time | Quality | API Required | Cost |
|------|---------------|---------|--------------|------|
| **Simple Mode** | < 1 second | Good | ❌ No | Free |
| **API Mode** | 2-5 seconds | Excellent | ✅ Yes | Paid |
### Performance Details:
- **Simple Mode**: Fast responses using keyword matching and sentence extraction
- **API Mode**: Higher quality responses but requires API key and internet connection
- **Scalability**: Can handle knowledge bases up to several MB efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory footprint for the simple mode
